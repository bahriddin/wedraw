# Wedraw
This is distributed Wedraw project. Originally, it is designed for Distributed Systems by **Quad** team which consists of:
- Yi Zhao
- Boheng Luan
- Maoyuan Xue
- and me.

You can find documentation on the **[wiki pages](https://github.com/bahriddin/wedraw/wiki)**.

It is Java project. You can generate server and client packages using src/Server/Network.java and src/GUI/run/run files' main methods, respectively (or use built jar files):

    # run server file first
    >_ java -jar server.jar [port_number]

    # next, run client file
    >_ java -jar client.jar

All the other part is in the GUI. Enjoy!
